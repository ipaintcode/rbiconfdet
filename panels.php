				<p>Fogelman was responsible for coordinating all of the marketing activities of the Council, including newsletters, eNewsletters, website, brochures and more, and directing and planning all aspects of the annual Comerica TasteFest.

				<p>Fogelman is the author of Detroit’s New Center by Arcadia Publishing.  Detroit’s New Center traces the history of New Center from its founding in the beginning of the twentieth century to the promising future through historic and new photos. He is currently working on a similar book about the rich history of the Eastern Market District.  Fogelman is also president of the homeowners' association of the renovated loft warehouse, in Midtown, Detroit, where he lives.  Fogelman has lived in the City of Detroit since 1994.</p>

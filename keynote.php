				<h5>Tony Goldman, Chief Executive Officer, Goldman Properties</h5>
				<p>For forty years, Tony Goldman has been recognizing the value in depressed, undervalued urban areas, reconstructing and transforming declining historic districts into popular, thriving global destinations. Goldman has been recognized as the driving force behind the transformations of the Upper West Side, the Wall Street Financial District and Soho in New York City, Center City in Philadelphia, and South Beach in Miami Beach. The New York Times dubbed Goldman “the granddaddy of South Beach, who time and again is credited with recognizing the potential in the crumbling pastel treasures of Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue.”</p>
				<p>His most recent undertaking is the transformation of the warehouse district in Wynwood, Miami’s emerging arts district. Acquiring 25 properties in Wynwood, Goldman is overseeing a master plan to create an artistically driven, tasteful, and architecturally exciting pedestrian neighborhood.</p>
				<p>Goldman’s uncanny instinct for recognizing urban trends goes hand in hand with a creative approach to revitalizing down trodden neighborhoods. The synergy of this multifaceted approach has become his hallmark. He translates the pioneer’s excitement of discovery into sound financial investments, while respecting, enhancing and embellishing the historic architecture and cultural roots of all the districts he undertakes. Together with daughter Jessica Goldman Srebnick and son Joey, the three Goldmans are the family principals of the innovative company.</p>
				<p>He is the founder and chairman of Miami Beach’s Ocean Drive Association and a member of the National Board of Trustees of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, as well as a past two-term chairman of both the Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau and the Historic Hotels of America. He recently received the Louise Du Pont Crowninshield Award, the highest accolade bestowed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation</p>

				<h5>Veronika Scott, The Empowerment Plan:</h5>

				<p>Less than two years ago, Veronika Scott walked passed an abandoned playground in Detroit and saw a group of homeless people using their own clothing as makeshift housing. Shortly following this, Veronika embarked on a quest to help over 32,000 homeless Detroiters by providing them with something basic, but much needed: a winter coat.</p>
				<p>Today, she's running her non-profit company, the Empowerment Plan, in Detroit’s Corktown that produces innovative self-heating coats that transform into waterproof sleeping bags. And she's handing them out to the same people that helped her generate the idea. As Scott points out, "for those who have no home, their coat is also their shelter," so rather than just clothe those in need, she's developed this hybrid shelter and garment—the coat turns into a sleeping bag, using body heat captured during the day to provide extra warmth at night.</p>

				<h5>Delphia Simmons, Thrive Detroit:</h5>

				<p>Thrive Detroit was born out of the vision of Delphia Simmons. As a Project Manager for Coalition On Temporary Shelter (COTS), Simmons was very familiar with the struggles of so many Detroiters who simply needed an opportunity to help them regain self-sufficiency and stability. Upon traveling, Simmons noticed that many other major cities offered "street newspapers" as an entrepreneurial tool for the unhoused and vulnerably housed population.  As Detroit has had its share of bumps and bruises most recently, Simmons thought this the perfect opportunity to create a similar platform back home.</p>
				<p>THRIVE DETROIT is a new, monthly street paper, with the mission of empowering individuals struggling with extreme poverty to participate on a new level in the community through self-employment, job training, and collaboration. The paper itself covers social justice issues, primarily poverty-related, and local content; it also seeks to be a voice for vendors and the unhoused. This newspaper is produced as a vehicle toward self-sufficiency and success for those experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.</p>

				<h5>Bobby Smith, En Garde! Detroit:</h5>

				<p>En Garde! Detroit is a social enterprise which utilizes the transformative effects of Fencing to better the community. Its core belief is that Fencing is an effective youth development tool for at-risk youth based on documented and personal experiences.</p>
				<p>En Garde! Detroit was founded by Bobby C. Smith a Jamaican immigrant and now Detroit local. As a child, Bobby was accepted into the Peter Westbrook Foundation (PWF) in New York City. The PWF was established to fund at-risk youth who wish to learn Fencing and compete across the world. Bobby used his talents and earned an athletic scholarship which made college a reality. With little financially support, ten sets of fencing equipment and a vision; Bobby began his dream of creating S.H.A.R.P. kids. Mr. Smith serves as a testament to the disadvantaged youth that success can be obtained by anyone willing to take the necessary steps.</p>
				<p>While fencing is important to Bobby, he is unique because of his multifaceted skill base which he uses to develop positive collaborations around the city. While serving on boards and consulting in the areas of marketing, advertising, &amp; event planning, Bobby has established relationships vital to the growth of En Garde! Detroit and our communities. Currently, he serves as the Director of Youth Affairs for the District 6 of Michigan, appointed by State Representative Fred Durhal, Jr.</p>

				<h5>Suzanne Vier, Simply Suzanne and Tashmoo Biergarten:</h5>

				<p>Suzanne was born and raised in Michigan, and like many Midwesterners, she grew up on wholesome and home-cooked meals which were oftentimes prepared with ingredients fresh from her mom's garden.</p>
				<p>Suzanne moved to New York City to pursue a career in marketing and human resources. She enjoyed all NYC had to offer and also traveled extensively, always taking the time to sample fresh, local foods during her adventures. Suzanne was mostly self-taught during her "culinary journeys", by watching and learning from others. During a business trip to Michigan, Suzanne and a good friend experimented with homemade granola recipes. Suzanne was instantly convinced that it was too good to keep to themselves, and it was then that the idea to start a granola company was born – Simply Suzanne LLC, a Detoit-based, and now growing granola company.</p>
				<p>This past fall, in partnership with Aaron Weigner, Suzanne also launched the pop-up Tashmoo Biergarten. Receiving overflowing support to date, the Tashmoo Biergarten provides an outdoor venue for fall fun, sells Michigan beer and raises some funds to support economic development in Detroit.</p>
